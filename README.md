ðŸš€ Motion Detection using OpenCV (Python Project)
I recently worked on a real-time motion detection project using Python and OpenCV.
 
This program captures live video from the webcam, defines a Region of Interest (ROI), and detects motion based on pixel differences between consecutive frames.
 
When motion is detected inside the ROI, a message is displayed on the screen â€” "Motion Detected!"

ðŸ§  Key Skills Used:
Python
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Computer Vision

ðŸ’¡ Concepts Learned:
Frame differencing
Region of Interest (ROI) selection
Real-time video processing
Threshold-based motion detection

Iâ€™m continuously learning and building projects to strengthen my skills in the Data & AI domain.
